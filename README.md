## Codeforces Problem Solutions  

Here are some of the Codeforces problems solved using C, with links to the problem statements and a brief explanation of the solution:  

- **Problem 1**: [Beautiful Matrix](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/263/A)  
   Approach: Calculate the Manhattan distance to move the "1" to the center of the matrix.  

- **Problem 2**: [Amusing Joke](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/141/A)  
   Approach: Verify if the concatenated letters of two strings can rearrange to form the third string.  

- **Problem 3**: [Gravity Flip](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/405/A)  
   Approach: Simulate gravity by sorting the array of column heights in ascending order.
